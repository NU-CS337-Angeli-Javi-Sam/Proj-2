    The main function to extract and process a recipe from a specific website.

    This function orchestrates the entire process of fetching a recipe from a website,
    extracting relevant data, and creating a Recipe object to be used by a Virtual Chef.

    It follows the following steps:
    1. Initializes a Virtual Chef instance to assist the user in cooking a recipe.
    2. Specifies the URL of the recipe webpage to be fetched.
    3. Fetches the HTML content of the webpage using the specified URL.
    4. Extracts relevant recipe data from the HTML content.
    5. Creates a Recipe object from the extracted recipe data.
    6. Provides the Virtual Chef with the created Recipe object.

    Example:
    - Replace the 'url' variable with the URL of the desired recipe.
    - Execute the 'main' function to fetch, extract, and process the recipe.
